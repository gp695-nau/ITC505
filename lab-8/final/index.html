            <h2>Addendum: Development Process</h2>
            <p><strong>Creative Choices:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Used a 5x5 grid as the classic Lights Out configuration</li>
                <li>Implemented a yellow "on" state and dark gray "off" state for clear visual distinction</li>
                <li>Added smooth transitions for a polished user experience</li>
                <li>Used Times New Roman font for a classic, readable appearance</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p><strong>Technical Implementation:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Created a solvable random board by starting with all lights off and simulating random clicks</li>
                <li>Used the "is-off" class system to manage light states efficiently</li>
                <li>Implemented neighbor-toggling logic using row/column calculations</li>
                <li>Added win detection that checks if all squares have the "is-off" class</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p><strong>Challenges & Solutions:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Challenge:</strong> Ensuring the board is always solvable
                    <br><strong>Solution:</strong> Started with a solved state (all off) and simulated 20-30 random moves</li>
                <li><strong>Challenge:</strong> Managing the toggling of neighbors correctly
                    <br><strong>Solution:</strong> Created a helper function that calculates valid neighbor positions and toggles them</li>
                <li><strong>Challenge:</strong> Preventing multiple win alerts during the checking process
                    <br><strong>Solution:</strong> Used a setTimeout to delay the win check, allowing animations to complete</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p><strong>Insights Gained:</strong></p>
            <p>This project reinforced the importance of state management in game development. The key insight was that by reversing the problem (starting solved and working backwards), we could guarantee solvability. I also learned that small UX details like transition delays and visual feedback significantly improve the player experience.</p>
