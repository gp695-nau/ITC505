        <div class="verse-line">Two roads diverged in a yellow wood,</div>
        <div class="verse-line">And sorry I could not travel both</div>
        <div class="verse-line">And be one traveler, long I stood</div>
        <div class="verse-line">And looked down one as far as I could</div>
        <div class="verse-line">To where it bent in the undergrowth;</div>
      </div>

      <div class="stanza">
        <div class="verse-line">Then took the other, as just as fair,</div>
        <div class="verse-line">And having perhaps the better claim,</div>
        <div class="verse-line">Because it was grassy and wanted wear;</div>
        <div class="verse-line">Though as for that the passing there</div>
        <div class="verse-line">Had worn them really about the same,</div>
      </div>

      <div class="stanza">
        <div class="verse-line">And both that morning equally lay</div>
        <div class="verse-line">In leaves no step had trodden black.</div>
        <div class="verse-line">Oh, I kept the first for another day!</div>
        <div class="verse-line">Yet knowing how way leads on to way,</div>
        <div class="verse-line">I doubted if I should ever be back.</div>
